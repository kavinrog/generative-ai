# Generative AI Codes ðŸš€  

This repository focuses on **Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI-powered applications**. It includes research, implementation, and optimizations in **natural language processing, embeddings, vector databases, and knowledge retrieval**.

## ðŸ“Œ Key Topics
- **LLMs**: Fine-tuning, inference optimization, and scaling models.
- **RAG**: Enhancing retrieval mechanisms for knowledge-grounded responses.
- **Vector Databases**: Indexing with FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, and hybrid search (BM25 + Dense Retrieval).
- **MLOps & Deployment**: Implementing scalable AI pipelines with **Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS**.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter Notebooks for experimentation.
- `models/` - Pretrained & fine-tuned models.
- `data/` - Sample datasets for retrieval & training.
- `scripts/` - Utility scripts for preprocessing and evaluation.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repo and set up dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kavinrog/generative-ai.git
cd GenerativeAICodes
pip install -r requirements.txt
